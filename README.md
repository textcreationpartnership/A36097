1. A DISCOURSE OF LOCAL MOTION.

    _ I. A Body is in it ſelf indifferent to Reſt or Motion.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ II. If a Body be once at Reſt, it will ever remain therein.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ III. And if it be once in Motion, it continues alſo to move always.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ IV. That Reſt is not a meer Negation.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ V. That there is as much poſitive Action in Reſt, as in Motion.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ VI. Objections.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ VIII. This Quality, which is called Impetuoſity, lasts always.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ IX. The Bodies which we move, do ceaſe to move, becauſe they are impeded.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ X. A Demand for the ſafety of the following Demonstrations.

      * For Example:

    _ XI. A Body receiving ſucceſſively many Determinations, remains only affected with the laſt.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ XII. A free Body cannot be determin'd to move in a Curve Line, nor with unequal celerity.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ XIII. Every Body that moveth about a Center, endevours to recede from it.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ XVII. In the meeting of two Bodies there is made a percuſſion, which is mutual, and equally received in both.

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

      * For Example:

    _ XVIII. A moving Body, meeting with another Body that is quieſcent, gives it all its Motion, and remains it ſelf moveleſs.
